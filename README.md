# Kali Linux Tools Learning Journey 🚀

## Overview

This repository documents my learning journey with the tools of **Kali Linux**, a leading platform for penetration testing, ethical hacking, and security auditing. I've structured my approach by categorizing the tools based on functionality, including networking, vulnerability analysis, web app testing, and more.

### Why This Journey?
As I aim to master cybersecurity and ethical hacking, I am exploring various tools available in Kali Linux. The learning process is documented here, providing not only notes for myself but also a resource for others on a similar path.

## Roadmap 🛣️

The journey is divided into the following categories, each with practical examples:

1. **Networking Tools**  
   Tools like `Nmap`, `Wireshark`, and `Netcat` that help in discovering, analyzing, and understanding network traffic.

2. **Vulnerability Scanning & Exploitation**  
   Learn tools like `Metasploit` and `Nikto` to identify and exploit system vulnerabilities.

3. **Web Application Testing**  
   Tools such as `Burp Suite` and `Sqlmap` are crucial for testing web apps for security loopholes.

4. **Password Cracking**  
   Tools like `John the Ripper` and `Hydra` are covered for cracking passwords and testing authentication systems.

5. **Post-Exploitation & Maintaining Access**  
   Use tools like `Empire` and `Mimikatz` to escalate privileges and maintain access after an initial compromise.

6. **Forensics Tools**  
   Learn about `Autopsy` and `Binwalk` for analyzing and recovering data from compromised systems.

## Tools Documentation 📖
